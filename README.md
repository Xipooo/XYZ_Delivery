# XYZ Delivery Executive Summary

The purpose of this repository is to lay out the details of the Dojo Engagement program offering to XYZ Company from Liatrio. Within it you will find the following information:

- [Primary Goal](#primary-goal-of-this-engagement) and [Objectives](#objectives) of this program
- Personas that would most benefit from participating in this program
- Tools that will be utilized during the delivery of the program
- A preliminary schedule for the program delivery
- Delivery structure
- Slide deck presentation highlighting key information

## Primary Goal

The primary goal of this engagement is to move XYZ's on-premises product suite to a cloud based solution while also improving the sustainability of XYZ's products.

Any effort, resources, time, personnel, artifacts, and discussions dedicated to this program will be done so in the interest of achieving this goal. All items, *except for this goal*, are subject to change based on the needs of the client and discovery through iteration and feedback.

## Objectives

Below are the primary objectives and milestones that are intended to be achieved during the delivery of this program:

- Up-skill developers on a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery mindset
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated code validation and shorter lead times to deploy
- Improve coding standards using a Linter
- Utilize containerization as a tool to make infrastructure more modular
- Start deploying code to the cloud to simplify provisioning new environments
- Up-skill developers on TDD and ATDD to provide a more sustainable code base
- Implement DORA metrics to measure the change in performance of the development process

## Delivery Structure

A pilot cohort will be utilized in order to limit cost and gather initial feedback on the potential success of the program. In order to prepare and deliver a successful pilot cohort, the following phases will be rolled out.

### Observational Phase

During this phase, a two person team of Liatrio subject matter experts will observe and engage with the pre-selected students who will be attend the training. The purpose of this observational phase is to collect more detailed information about the common challenges the developers face. This will help the subject matter experts prioritize the skills and tools that will benefit the attendees the most.  

### Program Development Phase

During the program development phase, a team of Liatrio subject matter experts will curate learning materials from pre-existing content and draft new content where necessary. 

### Program Delivery Phase

### End of Pilot

## Entry Personas

The first pilot cohort should be comprised of software developers who are involved in both the development of the code as well as the deployment process. This will help provide the delivery team with the most relevant feedback about the adoption of new coding practices and development tools.

After the pilot cohort has been completed and relevant feedback from the participants and stakeholders has been collected, additional personnel types will be evaluated for inclusion in ongoing cohorts. 

## Tools

To ensure the best possible outcomes we recommend the following tools be utilized during the course of this program:

- Zoom for virtual video conferencing
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration of containers
- Git for source control management
- GitHub for central repository locations
- GitHub Actions for a Continuous Integration pipeline
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud infrastructure
