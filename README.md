# XYZ Delivery Executive Summary

XYZ Company is currently facing challenges with their development process which include difficulty starting new product environments, long lead times, and lack of consistency between the different product environments. In order to alleviate these challenges, XYZ Company has engaged Liatrio's services to help up-skill their development team on modern development practices, as well as migrate their products from an on-premises infrastructure to a cloud environment (AWS). Within this repository you will find relevant information about the solution Liatrio proposes in order to achieve the goal set out by XYZ Company. It contains the following:

- [Primary Goal](#primary-goal-of-this-engagement) and [Objectives](#objectives) of this program
- [Program delivery structure](#program-delivery-phase)
- [Personas that would most benefit from participating in this program](#entry-personas) *(hereafter referred to as **students**)*
- [Tools that will be utilized during the delivery of the program](#tools)
- A preliminary schedule for the program delivery
- Slide deck presentation highlighting key information

## Primary Goal

The primary goal of this engagement is to move XYZ's on-premises product suite to a cloud based solution while also improving the sustainability of XYZ's products.

Any effort, resources, time, personnel, artifacts, and discussions dedicated to this program will be done so in the interest of achieving this goal. All items, *except for this goal*, are subject to change based on the needs of the client and discovery through iteration and feedback.

## Objectives

Below are the primary objectives and milestones that are intended to be achieved during the delivery of this program:

- Up-skill students on a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery mindset
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated code validation and shorter lead times to deploy
- Improve coding standards using a Linter
- Utilize containerization as a tool to make infrastructure more modular
- Start deploying code to the cloud to simplify provisioning new environments
- Up-skill students on TDD and ATDD to provide a more sustainable code base
- Implement DORA metrics to measure the change in performance of the development process

## Delivery Structure

A pilot cohort will be utilized in order to limit cost and gather initial feedback on the potential success of the program. In order to prepare and deliver a successful pilot cohort, the following phases will be rolled out.

### Observational Phase

During this phase, a two person team of Liatrio subject matter experts will observe and engage with the pre-selected students who will be attend a pilot version of the training. The purpose of this observational phase is to introduce the Liatrio team to the students, grok as much as they can of the various working domains, and collect more detailed information about the common challenges the students face. This will help the subject matter experts prioritize the skills and tools that will benefit the attendees the most. 

### Program Development Phase

During the program development phase, a team of Liatrio subject matter experts will curate learning materials from pre-existing content and draft new content where necessary. A more specific timeline will be available after the observational phase of the engagement is complete, but will be no longer than 2 months unless otherwise discussed.

### Program Delivery Phase

The program delivery phase is where the Liatrio DevOps team of subject matter experts will begin training students of the pilot cohort. This will consist of 

### End of Pilot

## Entry Personas

The first pilot cohort should be comprised of software developers who are involved in both the development of the code as well as the deployment process. This will help provide the delivery team with the most relevant feedback about the adoption of new coding practices and development tools.

After the pilot cohort has been completed and relevant feedback from the participants and stakeholders has been collected, additional personnel types will be evaluated for inclusion in ongoing cohorts. 

## Tools

To ensure the best possible outcomes we recommend the following tools be utilized during the course of this program:

- Conference room with large monitor, desks, and chairs for group discussions
- Laptops with Windows, Linux, or MacOS operating systems
- Visual Studio Code to provide a modern and consistent development environment
- Zoom for virtual video conferencing when necessary
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration of containers
- Git for source control management
- GitHub for central repository locations
- GitHub Actions for a Continuous Integration pipeline
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud infrastructure
