### Pilot Cohort

The initial phase of this program will involve the formation of a pilot cohort comprising a maximum of 2 teams with 16 students in total. This approach has several advantages. It helps to keep initial costs low and reduces the risk of unproductive development efforts. It also provides an opportunity to gather valuable feedback that can help predict the program's success. Moreover, it allows for real-world testing and refinement of the program before it is implemented on a larger scale, leading to an improved user experience, higher adoption rates, and ultimately, a more successful program. Early identification and resolution of potential issues can also help reduce long-term costs and ensure a smoother rollout.

### Observational Phase

Once the two pilot teams have been identified, a duo of Liatrio experts will interact with the selected students. This observational phase serves multiple purposes. It allows the Liatrio team to familiarize themselves with the students, understand their various working domains, and gather detailed information about the challenges they commonly encounter. This information will enable the experts to prioritize the skills and tools that will be most beneficial to the attendees. 

Moreover, this approach provides an opportunity for early identification of potential issues, enabling proactive solutions and adjustments.

This approach ensures that the training is tailored to the specific needs and challenges identified during the observational phase. 

The timeline for this phase will be determined following the completion of the observational phase, but it will not exceed 2 months unless otherwise discussed. This structured approach allows for a thorough and thoughtful development process, ensuring that the training program is comprehensive, relevant, and effective. 

Moreover, this method allows for flexibility and adaptability, ensuring that any changes or adjustments can be made in a timely manner. This ultimately leads to a more successful training program that meets the needs of the participants and achieves the desired outcomes.

### Program Delivery Phase

During the program delivery phase, the Liatrio DevOps team, comprised of subject matter experts, will commence the training of the pilot cohort. Each day will start with a brief lecture to introduce the day's topic and set objectives for the morning exercise. This will be followed by a Dojo session in the afternoon for hands-on training, where students will work directly with production code. Both morning and afternoon sessions will incorporate pair and mob programming, with instructors actively engaging with groups to reinforce learned concepts. The week will conclude with retrospectives to assess the effectiveness of the learned practices. Regular check-ins with product owners and stakeholders will also be conducted weekly to ensure transparent communication of progress. More specifics about this phase can be found in the ["Preliminary Schedule"](#preliminary-schedule) section below.

### End of Pilot

After the program delivery is complete, Liatrio will implement the Kirkpatrick model to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. This model consists of four levels of evaluation:

- Level 1: Reaction - How did the students react to the training?
- Level 2: Learning - How much did the students learn?
- Level 3: Behavior - How much did the students change their behavior?
- Level 4: Results - How much did the training impact the business?

The Kirkpatrick model will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training at each level. The results of this evaluation will be used to determine the next steps for the program. 

## Entry Personas

The inaugural pilot cohort will primarily consist of software developers who are actively involved in both the coding and deployment processes. This strategic selection is designed to provide the delivery team with pertinent feedback regarding the adoption of new coding practices and development tools, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the program.

Upon completion of the pilot cohort, feedback from participants and stakeholders will be meticulously analyzed. This invaluable input will guide the evaluation of additional personnel types for inclusion in future cohorts. This iterative approach ensures continuous improvement and adaptation of the program to meet diverse needs, ultimately leading to a more robust and successful training initiative.

## Preliminary Schedule

### Sandbox and Dojo Sessions

The daily schedule will be divided into two sessions, separated by a one-hour lunch break. The morning sessions will focus on introducing new concepts, providing a solid theoretical foundation, and exercises within a sandbox environment to allow for practice and experimentation. The afternoon sessions, on the other hand, will be dedicated to practical application in a Dojo environment. Students will identify real-world items to work on during Dojo time with the assistance of Liatrio's team of experts and other students in the program. This hands-on approach allows students to apply what they've learned to their own code base, fostering a deeper understanding and mastery of the material. 

Immediate feedback from the Liatrio team during these practice sessions further enhances the learning experience. It not only helps students correct mistakes in real-time but also provides them with personalized guidance and support. This structured yet flexible learning environment promotes active engagement, encourages problem-solving, and ultimately leads to more effective skill acquisition and application.

### Timeline

The initial five weeks of the training will be dedicated to a set of prioritized topics, providing a structured learning path. The final week will be utilized for revisiting previous topics based on the progress and needs of the students, and addressing any additional topics deemed important by Liatrio's team of trainers. This approach ensures a comprehensive review and reinforcement of learned concepts, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the training. Additionally, it allows for customization of the curriculum to better meet the needs of the students, leading to improved outcomes and greater student satisfaction.
